The <b>original iPad</b> was an iPhone gone IMAX and the first successful
tablet the world had ever seen. On January 27, 2010, Steve Jobs took the
state at an Apple special event to give one of the most important
keynote speeches of his life and in the history of consumer electronics.
The Mac had been introduced decades before, and the iPhone was only a
few years old. Jobs made the case that there was room for a new category
of device in between them. The <b>original iPad</b> had a 9.7 inch
screen and no camera! By April of 2011, Apple had discontinued the
original iPad and the total sales had reached over 15 million units.
That was <em>more than the original iPhone sold in it's first year and
more than every other tablet combined had ever sold</em>

<p class="second">

The <b>iPad 2</b> was made thinner, lighter, and faster. On March 2,
2011, Steve Jobs returned to the keynote stage and came back with a much
better idea for the iPad. The iPad2 had the same 9.7 inch screen but was
up to twice as fast for CPU and up to 9 times as fast for GPU tasks. It was 33% thinner and weont from 1.5 to 1.33 lbs. There were cameras
added, back and front. </p>

<p class=third"> 
The <b>iPad 3</b> went Retina and LTE.
Apple's third generation, 2012 iPad, called simply the New iPad was announced on March 7, 2012. It looks virtually identical to the 2011 iPad 2, but its technology
is far more advanced. The cameras did not satisfy users and was not that
impressive. Apple discontinued the iPad 3 after only 6 months, replacing it
with the iPad 4</p>

<p class="fourth">
The <b>iPad 4 </b> made Retina and LTE even better. The announcement was made
on October 23, 2013. While it still looks like the 2011 iPad2, it is has an
Apple A6x processor, international LTE networking and a FaceTime HD camera that
combine to make it a reasonable upgrade. This iPad was discontinued in the
spring of 2013 and replaced by the <b>iPad air</b>. It came back in the spring
of 2014 to replace the <b>iPad 2</b>. 
The <b>iPad mini</b> showed portability
could be just as important as power.
